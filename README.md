AD&D Enhanced is a framework for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons tabletop
roleplaying game. The purpose of this program is to provide a medium for
the dungeon master to better manage his party by keeping track of the
player's character sheets and inventories. AD&D Enhanced also has other
features such as calculators for some of the more tedious aspects of
AD&D, as well as lookup tables for information, such as equipment tables
and the infamous THAC0.

CHANGES:
 - Added weapon information tables.

TODO:
 - Add XML files containing the data for the remaining tables.
 - Add Miscellaneous category for other tables.
 - Work on Character class to keep track of character information,
   such as inventory and stats.
 - Add functionality to Character menu.

KNOWN ISSUES:
 - None
